        page should create a new broker entry. The required fields are first 
        and last name, email and phone. Other, not-required fields are company 
        name, address (number, city, state, zip) and possibly a large text box 
        for a description of the brokers specialties. Also, each broker should 
        have a "list" of lenders that they shop their loans to. All lenders in 
        this list must be in the overall database. The list is initially empty, 
        but this page should have a place for the list. For now, do not have the
        capability to add lenders from this page, but in the future we could.
